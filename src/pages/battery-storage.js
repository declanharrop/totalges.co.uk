          <h3>Energy Independence</h3>
          <p>
            Energy independence is a compelling benefit of solar batteries, and
            it represents a transformative shift in the way individuals and
            businesses consume electricity.

          <h3>Continuous Power Supply</h3>
          <p>
            We have the ability to instal a plug socked that leads directly to
            your solar panel batteries. Meaning, in the event of a power outage,
            you can still power your essential devices from the power stored in
            your batteries.

          <h3>Become Less Dependant on the National Grid</h3>
          <p>
            By using batteries, you can reduce dependence on the grid and
            therefore have more control over your energy consumption and
            expenses. This means that you can power your home during grid
            outages, disruptions, or fluctuations in energy supply.
